Mark your calendars for **October 17–19, 2025**, when the OpenInfra community converges on École Polytechnique in Paris‑Saclay for the much‑anticipated [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/). The [schedule](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule) for the event is now live, and among the open infrastructure focused tracks, there are several sessions highlighting progress around edge and telco use cases that cover StarlingX.

The OpenInfra Summit schedule is curated by experts from the global community who volunteer their time to make the content as engaging and representative as possible. Check out the [StarlingX-related sessions](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule#view=calendar&tags=4841):
