---

The StarlingX virtualization platform focuses on easy deployment, low touch manageability, rapid response to events and
fast recovery -- think control at the edge, control between IoT and cloud, and control over your virtual machines.

Rather than reference platforms and gap definition for edge use cases, StarlingX provides a deployment-ready, scalable
and highly reliable edge infrastructure software platform to build mission critical edge clouds. Tested and released as
a complete stack, StarlingX ensures compatibility among diverse open source components. Its unique project components
provide fault management and service management among others to ensure high availability of user applications. The
StarlingX community has optimized the solution for security, ulta-low latency, extremely high service uptime, and
streamlined operation.
