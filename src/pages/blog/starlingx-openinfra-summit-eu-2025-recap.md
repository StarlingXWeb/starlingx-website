StarlingX and the broader OpenInfra community recently gathered at École Polytechnique in Paris‑Saclay for the much‑anticipated [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/), on October 17–19, 2025. The event provided a great opportunity for attendees to share knowledge, maintain existing and build new connections and learn more about OpenInfra projects such as StarlingX.

The StarlingX project was featured in multiple presentations throughout the event to highlight some of its strength and capabilities, and the session recordings are now available!

#StarlingX at Scale
The StarlingX platform was designed to break out of the walls of traditional datacenters to provide infrastructure for geographically distributed systems. Many use cases, especially in the edge computing space, require software infrastructure to scale seamlessly. One of StarlingX’s strengths is the ability to scale, while still being easy to manage, upgrade and able to serve the needs of high-performance applications.

The [StarlingX Edge Orchestration: Managing Critical Workloads at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofq6Fk3LMvk) presentation highlighted the StarlingX platform’s architecture, with a focus on orchestration and platform upgrades.

#High Availability(HA) with StarlingX
Telecom networks are famous from having impeccable uptime, since Service Level Agreements don’t grant more than 5 minutes of downtime per year. Calls and data access has to be available at all times, which is important for emergencies and customer satisfaction in general. The StarlingX platform has been stress tested by telecom operators for years, and it passed the test. But what’s its secret?

The [Building Resilient Systems: Lessons from High Availability Architecture in StarlingX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBijsY6sweM) presentation focused on how the HA configurations work in StarlingX, along with real-world examples.

#Kubernetes and Radio Access Network (RAN) Management
Modern telecom and RAN deployments rely more and more on the use of containers, and with that Kubernetes. Building, managing and operating these highly distributed environments is no small feat. There are multiple communities and standards organizations that focus on this area, like the O-RAN Alliance and ETSI. The StarlingX community has been working with some of these groups to ensure compliance and interoperability, for instance with the O2 Interface defined in the O-RAN architecture.

The [Transforming Telecom: Kubernetes in Radio Access Network Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn33NX0vnnY) session focused on the management access of RAN deployments and how Kubernetes is used in these environments, with highlighting StarlingX as a platform that can be used to deploy and manage such systems.

#Edge Computing and AI
AI is present everywhere, which means that it will be used throughout the network, in large datacenters all the way out to the end users. AI workloads tend to be resource intensive, while relying on large amounts of data. Processing the data close to the source is crucial as it often cannot be moved. Being able to train models at the edge is a desire in certain cases, but the edge sites need to be ready for running those workloads. So, how does an Edge AI architecture look like?

The [Next Generation Edge: Edge Computing Architectures for AI/ML Use Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ld1BNcTd7I) presentation focused on sharing the highlights of the recently published [Next Generation Edge: Edge Computing Architectures for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Use Cases](https://www.openstack.org/use-cases/edge-computing/next-generation-edge-edge-computing-architectures-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-use-cases) white paper. While the presentation didn’t call out StarlingX specifically, it discussed requirements and recommendations on how to use a platform like StarlingX to build Edge AI infrastructures.
