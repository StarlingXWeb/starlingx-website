        StarlingX is a complete cloud infrastructure software stack for the edge
        used by the most demanding applications in industrial IOT, telecom,
        video delivery and other ultra-low latency use cases. With deterministic
        low latency required by edge applications, and tools that make
        distributed edge manageable, StarlingX provides a container-based
        infrastructure for edge implementations in scalable solutions that is
        ready for production now.
