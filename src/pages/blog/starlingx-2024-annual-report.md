The [StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io) community concluded a strong year in 2024, including [2 major](https://docs.starlingx.io/releasenotes/index.html#release-notes) releases and delivering important functionality to new and emerging use cases that rely on large-scale, high-performance, open-source cloud infrastructure.

The community enhanced and strengthened the platform in the following areas:
- Scalability
- Security
- Management and operations
- Distributed cloud

In 2024, the community put significant effort into keeping up to date with the latest versions of the integrated components of the platform, while also enhancing the services that are designed and developed by the StarlingX community, like the Flock services, to provide all the necessary components to deploy, operate and maintain a distributed cloud platform.

The OpenStack subproject experienced significant growth in the second half of 2024, which will allow the team to move faster with integrating newer versions of OpenStack into StarlingX, while also adding new features and enhancing testing in this area.

To ensure continued leadership while also giving the opportunity for new leaders to arise, the community conducted two Technical Steering Committee elections and one Project and Technical Lead election throughout the year.

The project continued to grow in production use in the telecommunications segment, including [Boost Mobile](https://www.windriver.com/news/press/news-20241203), a new production use case announced in December. At the same time, the community has been exploring potential use cases in sectors such as automotive and industrial automation to further increase the platform's adoption.
