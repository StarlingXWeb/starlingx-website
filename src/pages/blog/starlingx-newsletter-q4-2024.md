Welcome to our latest update on the StarlingX project! We’re excited to share our progress, recent milestones, and what’s coming up next. This post covers the key achievements from the past month and gives a sneak peek into the upcoming work.

# Key Achievements
Over the past month, the StarlingX community has:
- participated in the [Project Teams Gathering (PTG)](https://openinfra.dev/ptg/) event, where contributors provided an overview of the work that has been done in the 10.0 release cycle so far, and shared plans for the 11.0 cycle. You can find an [overview of the sessions](https://www.starlingx.io/blog/starlingx-vptg-october-2024-recap/) on the project’s blog;
- concluded the Technical Steering Committee, Project Leads and Technical Leads elections. The community runs periodic elections, which are meritocracy based and provide the opportunity for new leaders to step up and take on responsibilities to help the community further advance the project. You can find the newly elected [TSC members](https://docs.starlingx.io/governance/reference/tsc/index.html), as well as [PLs and TLs](https://docs.starlingx.io/governance/reference/tsc/projects/index.html) in StarlingX project documentation.

# What’s Coming Up

Looking ahead, we’re excited about the next steps in the StarlingX journey. Here’s a preview of what to expect:
- Contributors are working hard to finalize the last steps in the 10.0 release cycle. As the testing activities wrap up, the community is expecting the release to come out in December, 2024.
- Highlights from the 10.0 release include
  - IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack support
  - Integrating the Harbor container registry into the platform to securely manage artifacts in the cloud-native landscape
  - Increase the platform’s scalability to be able to manage up to 5,000 sites per system controller
  - and more
